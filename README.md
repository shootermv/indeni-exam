### Tools I Used To Build This App:

* [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/) - JS bundling tool with zero configuration needed!
* [Reach Router](https://reach.tech/router) - Great router imlpementation for React!
* [React Context Api](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html) - A new way of share data between components (become stable at recent versions)!
* [React Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) - More convenient way of writing react components introduced recently by React great Guys!

* [randomuser](https://randomuser.me) - For generate cool avatar images
* [Mockaroo](https://mockaroo.com/) - For generate json
