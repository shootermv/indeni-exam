## How To Use
### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:1234](http://localhost:1234) to view it in the browser.

### Tools I Used To Build This App:

* [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/) - JS bundling tool with zero configuration needed!
* [Reach Router](https://reach.tech/router) - HTML enhanced for web apps!
* [React Context Api](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html) - HTML enhanced for web apps!
* [React Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) - HTML enhanced for web apps!


I know - some of the tools might seem to you as uncommon - but hey, i wanted to demonstrate that sometimes even when something is uncommon - it still can be good (so why not use it?)...  

(Also i wanted to have little fun doing this assesment, and i think i deserve some fun too!)
